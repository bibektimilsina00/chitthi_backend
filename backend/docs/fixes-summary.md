# Issues Fixed - Summary

## 🔧 SQLAlchemy Relationship Warnings

### Problem

SQLAlchemy was showing warnings about overlapping relationships:

```
SAWarning: relationship 'MessageEncryptedKeys.recipient_device' will copy column device.id to column messageencryptedkeys.recipient_device_id, which conflicts with relationship(s): 'Device.message_encrypted_keys'
```

### Solution

Fixed by adding proper `back_populates` relationships:

**In `app/models/device.py`:**

```python
message_encrypted_keys: list["MessageEncryptedKeys"] = Relationship(
    back_populates="recipient_device", cascade_delete=True
)
message_statuses: list["MessageStatus"] = Relationship(
    back_populates="device", cascade_delete=True
)
```

**In `app/models/message.py`:**

```python
# MessageEncryptedKeys class
recipient_device: "Device" = Relationship(back_populates="message_encrypted_keys")

# MessageStatus class
device: Optional["Device"] = Relationship(back_populates="message_statuses")
```

## 📦 WebSocket Support

### Problem

Server was showing warnings:

```
WARNING: No supported WebSocket library detected. Please use "pip install 'uvicorn[standard]'", or install 'websockets' or 'wsproto' manually.
```

### Solution

Added WebSocket support packages:

```bash
uv add 'uvicorn[standard]' websockets
```

## 🔄 Seed Script Improvements

### Problem

Seed script was failing when trying to create duplicate user profiles:

```
sqlalchemy.exc.IntegrityError: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "userprofile_pkey"
```

### Solution

Added existence checks in `create_test_user_profiles()`:

```python
# Check if profile already exists
existing = session.exec(
    select(UserProfile).where(UserProfile.user_id == user.id)
).first()

if existing:
    profiles.append(existing)
    continue
```

## ⚠️ Remaining Warnings (Non-Critical)

### bcrypt Version Warning

```
(trapped) error reading bcrypt version
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "...passlib/handlers/bcrypt.py", line 620, in _load_backend_mixin
    version = _bcrypt.__about__.__version__
AttributeError: module 'bcrypt' has no attribute '__about__'
```

**Status:** This is a known compatibility issue between newer bcrypt versions and passlib. The functionality still works correctly - it's just a version detection issue. The warning can be safely ignored.

### DateTime Deprecation Warnings

```
DeprecationWarning: datetime.datetime.utcnow() is deprecated and scheduled for removal in a future version. Use timezone-aware objects to represent datetimes in UTC: datetime.datetime.now(datetime.UTC).
```

**Status:** These are deprecation warnings for Python 3.12+ compatibility. The code works fine but should be updated in the future to use `datetime.now(datetime.UTC)` instead of `datetime.utcnow()`.

## ✅ Current Status

- ✅ **SQLAlchemy relationship warnings**: FIXED
- ✅ **WebSocket support**: ADDED
- ✅ **Seed script errors**: FIXED
- ✅ **Server functionality**: WORKING
- ⚠️ **bcrypt warning**: NON-CRITICAL (functionality works)
- ⚠️ **datetime warnings**: NON-CRITICAL (future compatibility)
